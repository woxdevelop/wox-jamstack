  Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
  I was part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. We gotta burn the rain
  forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe
  if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!
f_paragraph-2: >-
  Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does
  it really exist? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you,
  Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! God help us,
  we're in the hands of engineers.
f_closing-paragraph: >-
  You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do
  you need a manager? What do they got in there? King Kong? Just my luck, no
  ice. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Forget the fat lady!
  You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!
