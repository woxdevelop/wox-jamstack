  Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Forget the fat lady! You're
  obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Checkmate... God help us,
  we're in the hands of engineers. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A
  computer virus. You really think you can fly that thing?
f_paragraph-2: >-
  Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
  I was part of something special. Just my luck, no ice. We gotta burn the rain
  forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe
  if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

  Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Jaguar shark! So tell me - does
  it really exist? My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you,
  Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! God help us,
  we're in the hands of engineers.

  Did he just throw my cat out of the window? My dad once told me, laugh and the
  world laughs with you..
